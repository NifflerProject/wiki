# FAQ

### Is Niffler a mining pool?

No. At the early stage, Niffler only serves as a proxy-like network for miners to generate hashrate proofs. Niffler will not affect the normal mining process. In the future, Niffler may act as a decentralized pool.

### What blockchains will Niffler support first?

On the proof side, we'll support BTC & ETH hashrate first, as they're the most influential PoW blockchains. However, Niffler is designed as a blockchain agnostic protocol, will support arbitrary hashrate & mining power to join in the future.

As for the smart contract part, we'll deploy on Solana first, as it's fast, cheap, and user-friendly. 

### How can the hashrate proofs be used?

We implemented a hashrate asset mint tool and marketplace as a sample to show that how the hashrate proofs can be used in a very straightforward. But like any DeFi protocol, the builders are free to use the proofs in any way they like.
